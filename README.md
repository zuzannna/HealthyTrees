# Healthy-NYC-Trees
How can we use the Street Tree Census Data to more efficiently plan for the long term health of the urban forest?
I celebrated National Day of Civic Hacking on June 4th 2016 by participating in TreesCount hackathon hosted by NYC Parks where I analyzed the health of the urban forest to facilitate more efficient disctribution of financial resources across the boroughs. 

My goal was to gain actionable insights and:
* identify the key indicators of poor health
* forecast which areas are likely to need more funds in the future

To this aim I followed three step method:
* data import exploration
* analysis and modeling
* model validation

What drawn me to this project is that the data was collected with help of numerous volunteers during 2015 census. Those volunteers (and NYC Park staff) walked every street in NYC and laboriously recorded the GPS coordinates, species and health indicators of almost 500.000 trees. Isn't it amazing?
The dataset is available at https://nycopendata.socrata.com, feel free to play with it yourself, it's very well documented.
